"""Periodic cleanup task.

Fires from the timekeeper on a schedule (default 4 AM daily). One task,
two responsibilities — kept together so the schedule has one source of
truth and config has one place to look.

1. **Canvas render cache eviction.** Walks ``DATA_DIR/canvas_renders/``
   and, if total size exceeds the configured cap, deletes the
   least-recently-used pool folders until the directory is back under
   the cap.

   "Least recently used" is per-pool:
   - Primary signal: ``MAX(ts)`` from ``user_canvas_actions`` for that
     pool_hash (share / save / download / remix / link_open).
   - Fallback: folder mtime, for pools no one has ever acted on. On
     content-addressed renders this is the moment the pool was first
     populated, since the files are never rewritten.

   Deleted pools keep their ``canvas_pools`` row — the canvas
   definition is durable. If anyone visits the share link later,
   ``pool_share_payload`` re-renders on demand with a fresh seed (same
   composition, different RNG draw).

2. **Stale ephemeral conversation pruning.** Deletes
   ``category = 'Art'`` conversations older than
   ``conversation_max_age_hours`` that are not currently bound to a
   live session. Captures tabs people closed without hitting
   "New chat".
